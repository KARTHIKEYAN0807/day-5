In JavaScript, when dealing with web browsers and manipulating their content,
understanding the difference between window, screen, and document is essential.
These are all objects that represent different aspects of the browser environment and the content it displays.

Window Object (window):

The window object represents the browser window that contains the document loaded into the window.
It is the top-level object in the browser's JavaScript hierarchy and acts as a global object for the current 
browsing context.

The window object provides access to various properties and methods related to the browser window, such as:

window.document:

 Returns the document object associated with the current window.

window.location:

 Provides information about the current URL and allows navigation to new URLs.

window.alert(), window.prompt(), window.confirm(): 

Methods for displaying alert, prompt, and confirmation dialogs.

window.setTimeout(), window.setInterval():

 Methods for scheduling execution of functions after a specified delay
or at regular intervals.

It also serves as the global scope for JavaScript code executed within the browser.

Document Object (document):

The document object represents the HTML document that is currently displayed in the browser window.

It is a property of the window object (window.document) and provides methods and properties to manipulate the 
content and structure of the document.

The document object allows you to access and modify elements in the HTML document using methods like
 getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), querySelector(), querySelectorAll().

It provides access to properties like document.title (to get or set the title of the document), document.body 
(to access the <body> element of the document), and document.cookie (to manipulate cookies).
Screen Object (screen):

The screen object represents the properties of the screen on which the current window is being rendered.
It provides information such as the dimensions of the screen (screen.width, screen.height), color depth 
(screen.colorDepth), and pixel density (screen.pixelDepth).


The screen object is useful for determining the available screen size and resolution, which can be used for 
responsive design or adjusting layouts based on screen properties.

Summary:

window: 

Represents the entire browser window and acts as the global object for the current browsing context.
It provides access to the document object, among other browser-related properties and methods.

document: 

Represents the HTML document loaded into the browser window and provides methods and properties to
interact with and manipulate the document's content and structure.

screen: 

Represents the properties of the screen where the browser window is being displayed, such as dimensions
and color depth. It provides information about the physical characteristics of the screen.
